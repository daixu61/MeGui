These are sources from a development branch.
I decided to backup my own stuff.
Some new bugs may appear.

What are the main differences within the megui trunk ?

-> Removed:
   - ffac3, ffmp2, aud-x, faac encoders.
   - changelog form.
   - old job loading files.

-> Added:
   - DivX264 encoder.
   - Zones refactoring.
   - M2TS muxer.
